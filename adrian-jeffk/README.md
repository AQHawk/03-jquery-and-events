## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is a blog where a user can enter new articles into blogArticles.js and the articles are added to index.html.  We had to do the following tasks:
- Pick one CSS styling from what each partner wrote yesterday, or merge them together.
- Make dropdown menus select articles by author or category.
- Make the menu switch between tabs.
- Click a button so that it shows the rest of the article.
